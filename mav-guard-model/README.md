# MavGuard Model Module

## Overview
The Model module is the foundation of the MavGuard system, providing the core data structures that represent Maven project components. It defines the domain model used throughout the application for parsing and analyzing Maven POM files.

## Core Concepts

### Project Representation
The module provides a comprehensive object model that maps directly to Maven POM file structures:

- **Project**: Represents a complete Maven project with all its metadata and dependencies
- **Dependency**: Represents a standard Maven dependency with its coordinates and properties
- **PluginDependency**: Represents Maven build plugins used in the project

### XML Binding
All model classes are annotated with JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) annotations, enabling seamless conversion between XML and Java objects. This allows the system to:

- Parse POM files directly into structured Java objects
- Maintain the hierarchical relationship between project elements
- Preserve all relevant metadata for analysis

### Key Features
- Complete representation of Maven project structure
- Support for dependency management sections
- Plugin dependency tracking
- Immutable data structures with clear accessor methods

## Relationship to Other Modules

The Model module is used by:

- **XML Parser Module**: Uses these model classes as targets for XML deserialization
- **CLI Module**: Displays and processes the model objects for user interaction

As the foundation of the system, this module has no dependencies on other MavGuard modules, maintaining a clean architecture where higher-level modules depend on it rather than the reverse.
