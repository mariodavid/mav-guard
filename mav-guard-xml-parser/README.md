# MavGuard XML Parser Module

## Overview
The XML Parser module is responsible for parsing and processing Maven POM files. It provides a clean, abstracted interface for converting XML-based POM files into structured Java objects that can be easily analyzed and manipulated by the application.

## Core Concepts

### XML Parsing
The module uses JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) to handle the conversion between XML and Java objects:

- **XmlParser**: A generic utility class for parsing any XML file into a specified Java class
- **PomParser**: A specialized parser that converts Maven POM files into Project objects
- **PomFileProcessor**: An interface defining the contract for POM file processing operations

### Key Features
- Robust error handling for malformed XML files
- Support for both file-based and stream-based parsing
- Validation of input files and streams
- Clean separation between generic XML parsing and Maven-specific parsing logic

### Design Principles
The module follows several important design principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a clear, focused purpose
- **Interface Segregation**: The PomFileProcessor interface defines a clear contract
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with meaningful error messages

## Relationship to Other Modules

The XML Parser module:

- **Depends on**: The Model module for the domain objects that represent Maven projects
- **Is used by**: The CLI module to provide XML parsing functionality to end users

This module serves as a bridge between the raw XML data in POM files and the structured object model used throughout the application. It encapsulates all XML parsing logic, allowing other modules to work with clean Java objects without worrying about the underlying XML structure.
